INSTRUCTIONS TO FIX DOWNLOAD ISSUE:

PROBLEM: Files have "ContentEncoding: br" metadata causing downloads
FIX: Remove that metadata

IN HUAWEI CLOUD CONSOLE:

1. Go to OBS → development-team bucket
2. For EACH file with ContentEncoding:
   - Click file → Metadata tab
   - Find "ContentEncoding: br"
   - Click "Delete" or "Edit"
   - Remove the ContentEncoding entry
   - Save

3. OR easier: Delete all and re-upload from dist/ folder
   - Make sure to NOT add any custom metadata
   - Use default upload settings

Files to fix:
- index.html (remove ContentEncoding: br)
- All files in assets/ folder

After fixing, refresh browser and it should display instead of download!
