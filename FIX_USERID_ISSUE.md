# Fix userId Undefined Issue

## THE PROBLEM:
Your state shows: `userId: undefined` even though OTP was verified.

## ROOT CAUSE:
You're using **old cached state** from localStorage. The new code with userId logging hasn't loaded.

## SOLUTION - Do These Steps:

### Step 1: Clear Browser State
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
localStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.clear()
location.reload()
```

### Step 2: Hard Refresh
Press: **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac) or **Ctrl + Shift + F5** (Windows)

### Step 3: Start Fresh Flow
1. Go to `http://localhost:5174` (note: port 5174, not 5173!)
2. Start from beginning with phone number entry
3. Watch console for these logs:

**Expected logs during OTP verification:**
```
üìû Calling verify-otp API with: { phoneNumber: "...", otp: "..." }
‚úÖ Backend response: { success: true, userId: "xxx-xxx-xxx" }
‚úÖ Dispatching VERIFY_OTP_SUCCESS with userId: xxx-xxx-xxx
```

**Expected logs on Password page:**
```
üîç State.data.userId: xxx-xxx-xxx  ‚Üê Should have ID!
‚úÖ Setting password for user: xxx-xxx-xxx
```

### Step 4: If Still No Logs
The new code hasn't loaded. Do this:
1. Stop the dev server (find terminal with vite and press Ctrl+C)
2. Restart: `cd /Users/saeedhar/plink && npm run dev`
3. Wait for "ready in XXXms"
4. Open browser, clear cache, refresh

## QUICK FIX COMMAND:
Run this in browser console:
```javascript
// Clear all state and reload
localStorage.clear(); sessionStorage.clear(); window.location.href = 'http://localhost:5174';
```

## IF YOU SEE THE LOGS:
They will show EXACTLY where the userId is getting lost. Then I can fix it.

## IF YOU DON'T SEE THE LOGS:
The new code hasn't loaded - do the steps above to force reload.
